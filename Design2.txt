			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================
			
			---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	#ifndef USERPROG_PROCESS_H
	#define USERPROG_PROCESS_H

	#include "threads/thread.h"

	tid_t process_execute (const char *file_name);
	int process_wait (tid_t);
	void process_exit (void);
	void process_activate (void);

	// max number of arguments that can be sent to a program
	#define MAXARGS 50 					<-- added

	#endif /* userprog/process.h */

We added a maximum number of arguments that can be passed.
This constraint will help us to avoid overflowing the stack.

			---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page? 
   1. In the load function, we copy the file name to parse it later
   2. In setup_stack we look through the filename to find the number of arguments
   3. then we allocate space for each argument + sentinel
   4. we used a for loop to add the arguments to the stack in reverse order
   5. we then add the argv and argument count to the stack
   6. release memory.



			---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()? - tw 10.6

   SAVE_PTR is the address of a `char *' variable used to keep
   track of the tokenizer's position.  The return value each time
   is the next token in the string, or a null pointer if no
   tokens remain. -- taken from string.c file

   strtok_r() uses that third argument to keep track of where the 
   tokenizer is at. This makes its safe for multi-threading. strtok()
   uses static variables that can be accessed by different threads, thus
   meaning it is not safe for multi threading. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach. - tw 10.6

   1. It's more advanced/efficient. With tab-completion, piping and 
   by being able to redirect files, then the execution of these files
   are spread out via the PATH variable.
  
   2. UNIX also parses the user input for you in the shell. This means 
   that the kernel does not have to do it, making the kernel more simple
   and the system more secure. 

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

			---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

			---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

   1. Create a temporary thread based on the child TID passed into the function
   2. We return -1 if... 
	i. child is invalid (== NULL) 
	ii. child is not a child of the current process
	iii. of if the child has already called wait 
   3. we decrease our waiting semaphore
   4. we increase the exit semaphore
   5. we set the temp thread waited to true

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

			---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

			---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
