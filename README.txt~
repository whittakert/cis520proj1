First I created the alarm-mega.ck file and save it in cis520/pintos/src/tests/threads.
Then I made changes/added code to the following files:

	tests.c CHECK -- added code     {"alarm-mega", test_alarm_mega}, 	line 16
	tests.h CHECK -- added code	 extern test_func test_alarm_mega; 	line 10
	alarm-wait.c CHECK -- added code 					lines 27-31
	Make.tests CHECK -- added code 		alarm-mega			line 5
	Rubric.alarm CHECK -- added code	 alarm-mega			line 4

Notes:
pintos/scr/threads --> where to make
I was never able to edit the bashrc, so I finished the project in one terminal session. 
tried to VI bashrc, but still no file/dir was found.
